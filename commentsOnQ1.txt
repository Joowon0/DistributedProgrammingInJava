1,2 about the pseudo-codes
As a funcitonal programming language, I don't get why there is no type missing.
It would be more beneficial to ask for coding for certain problem.
Also, the codes are psudo-codes not actually working codes.
They could be considered differently person by person.
I spent a lot of time to actually find out what [] means.

I don't really get the purpose of the questions.



2. The alternative choices are ambiguous.
Why there are no explainations about the key of data.
The printing is performed line by line.
ex)
If the input is :
data = (1, "Nice to meet you
            Great to meet you"),
       (2, "Great to meet you")
The print would be like :
Nice = 1
to = 1 2
meet = 1 2
you = 1 2
Great = 2
Great = 1
to = 1
meet = 1
you = 1

Thus, I don't get what 'sorted' means.
It will print in sorted way inside each line.



6.
What is terminal operation means?
The phrase is not a specialized one or something.
It would be better to ask "When does the computing occurs??" or something.
